This project consists of two main scripts: ScriptMain, ScriptOutlier, and a datasheet named dsa. Each script serves a specific purpose in the analysis and manipulation of data.

ScriptMain is the primary script designed for main analysis and plotting. This script is responsible for:

    Conducting comprehensive data analysis.
    Producing visualizations and plots to aid in understanding the data.

ScriptOutlier is dedicated to outlier detection and removal, this script is designed to:

    Identify outliers within the dataset.
    Implement appropriate methods for outlier removal or adjustment.

The dsa datasheet is a critical component of the project, containing the raw data that will be analyzed.
